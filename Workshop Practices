SHEET METAL SHOP

1. Which tool is used for folding the sheet from corners? 
Ans: Mallet or Nylon Hammer

2. Which sheet is used in sheet metal operations?
Ans: G.I Sheet

3. What are straight snips?
Ans: Straight snips are used for cutting a straight line and for curves having a large radius.

4. Name some striking tools used in sheet metal shop.
Ans: Mallet or Nylon Hammer

5. What is Galvanization? Why it is required? 
Ans: Galvanizing, or galvanization, is a manufacturing process where a coating of zinc is applied to steel or iron to offer protection against rusting.
The most commonly of used method is called hot-dip galvanizing. The hot dip galvanizing process involves cleaning steel and immersing it in molten zinc bath at a temperature of around 450 Â°C to obtain a coating. Galvanization provides extended durability, strength and formability of steel.

6. Name the different types of stakes used in sheet metal work?
Ans: Anvil

7. What is wire gauge?
Ans. Sheet metal gauge (SMG) indicates the standard thickness of sheet metal for a specific material. As the gauge number increases, the material thickness decreases. Whereas Wire gauge is a measurement of wire diameter.

8. What is flux and why it is used?
Ans. The main purpose of the flux is to prepare the metal surfaces for soldering by cleaning and removing any oxides and impurities. Oxides are formed when metal is exposed to air and may prevent the formation of good solder joints.

9. What are the engineering applications of sheet metal work? 
Ans. Sheet metal is used in automobile and truck (larry) bodies, airplane fuselages and wings, medical tables, roofs for buildings (architecture), and many other applications.

10. Describe the various processes of sheet metal work. 
Ans. Basically, the word sheet metal working refers to the manufacture of products, components and parts made of metal. In addition to welding, cutting and bending, the processes of sheet metal processing also include punching, forming, rolling and joining.
Miscellaneous:

What is soldering?
Ans. Soldering is a joining process used to join different types of metals together by melting solder.
